        <h1>Assignment 2.3 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>While growing up, I have always been interested in technology. The more I interacted with it, the more I wanted to learn how it works. This has led me to pursue Software Development through Bellevue University.</p>
        <p>In my spare time there are a variety of things that I enjoy doing. I go to the gym as frequent as I can. I play video games with some friends whom I have known for a long time. I try to read once I get the chance to. There are also others that I would like to get into as well like learning an instrument perhaps.</p>
        <p>In my family, I only have two other siblings. I am the youngest in my family. I have relatives all across the country that I occasionally see.</p>
        <p>A game that I am currently enjoying playing with friends is called Lethal Company. It has proximity chat, which makes the experience a whole lot better. The goal of the game is to acquire as much material as you can to sell to meet the quota.</p>
